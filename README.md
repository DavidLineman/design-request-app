What I am trying to Accomplish:

-Two types of users: Admin and Basic User. 

-Basic User can submit design requests

-Need a basic form for submitting design requests. 

-Admin User can aknowledge design requests. Then edit the request with an ETA. Once complete, the Admin can use mark the job complete--which them moves the design the the completed column. 

-When the form is submitted, an email is sent to the Admin--use Overtime app and SampApp as an example.

-Try to create tests in Rspec, using Firehose as an example

-When user logs in, they can see their design requests. Homepage shows all current active requests==maybe 20 latest


TO DO: 

- Finish Devise Setup X
